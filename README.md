# 🔢 Push_swap Tester

## This tester contains:

### 🔹 Error handling.

### 🔹 All the cases between 2 and 5 numbers. Check sorting and less movements than the mandatory.

### 🔹 Infinit test of 100 numbers and 500, and prints the moves that your algorithm does.

### 🔹 A test for each case between 1 and 500.

### 🔹 Test if the arguments is already sorted.

### 🔹 Show this min, max and average of all tests.

### 🔹 Check memory leaks.

### 🔹 Check for the bonus.

## How to use

The push_swap_test.sh file and the checker_OS should be in the same directory where is the push_swap program. Once the terminal is open and we are in the project directory we executed this command:

```bash push_swap_test.sh``` 

We also can add two arguments that will be the times that we executed the 100 and 500 tests. If you don't put arguments, it will execute 200 for each test by default.

```bash push_swap_test.sh 250 250```.

If you would like to execute the bonus. If you don't put arguments, it will execute 200 for each test by default. 

```bash push_swap_test.sh -b```.

And if you want to define the quantity for 100 and 500 tests:

```bash push_swap_test.sh -b 100 100```
